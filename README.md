# Device Network Art

This project is a network artistic simulation built using Python and Pygame. It visualizes multiple devices moving within a defined space, sending and receiving data packets. The simulation models device movement, data transmission, and interactions between devices, providing an engaging tool for exploring network dynamics and data flow in a visual and interactive environment.
