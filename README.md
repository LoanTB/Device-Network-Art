# Device Network Art

This project is a device network artistic simulation built using Python and Pygame. The simulation models a network of devices that move autonomously, send data packets to each other, and interact upon collisions. It provides a visual representation of data transmission and device interactions, making it an engaging tool for exploring network dynamics and interactions in a controlled environment.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pygame**: Install via pip with `pip install pygame`

## How to Run

1. **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/LoanTB/Device-Network-Art.git
    cd Device-Network-Art
    ```

2. **Install Pygame if Not Already Installed:**

    ```bash
    pip install pygame
    ```

3. **Run the Simulation:**

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

## Simulation Controls

- **Left Mouse Button**: Click and drag to pan the camera across the simulation space.
- **Mouse Wheel Up**: Zoom in to get a closer view of the network.
- **Mouse Wheel Down**: Zoom out to see a broader view of the network.
